# Founders and Coders Application Website 

This is my personal website application as part of the Founders and Coders Spring 2021 application prerequisites.
The criteria was to create the website using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript only, without using a Github theme or any JavaScript or CSS libraries.

## Improvements to make:

- Fix the image carousel which currently only automatically slides on page reload, except in Firefox.
- Improve the back to top button scroll which performs a smooth scroll on Android but a sudden jump on iPhone.
